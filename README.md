# Overview

**Alloc8** is an agentic asset allocation protocol enabling programmable delegation of funds through smart accounts. Whether you're a DAO automating treasury strategies, a yield optimizer seeking abstraction, or an LP aiming for passive yield, Alloc8 provides execution autonomy without sacrificing custody.
