# ðŸ§¬ Architecture

Alloc8's architecture combines:

- **Modular4337 Smart Wallets**
- **CamelotLiquidityManager Pools**
- **MEOW Agents or human operator modules**
- **EntryPoint** for user operation bundling

Smart accounts hold funds, while modules (agents) are granted temporary, policy-bound access.
