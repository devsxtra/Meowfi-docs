# Case Studies

Explore real-world scenarios where Alloc8â€™s agentic intelligence, policy-based execution has optimized liquidity performance. From DAOs managing millions in protocol-owned liquidity to retail users seeking hands-off yield, these case studies show measurable results and practical workflows.

#### **Example Case Studies**

**1. DAO Treasury - Camelot V3 Liquidity Optimization**

**Challenge:** DAO-held liquidity was frequently out of range, losing fee opportunities.\
**Solution:** Meow Agent dynamically adjusted tick ranges based on volatility bands and TWAP.\
**Result:** 63% higher fee capture vs. static ranges, with fewer than 5 rebalances per week, minimizing gas costs.

***

**2. Retail LP - Passive Uniswap V3 Positioning**

**Challenge:** Small LP user lacked time and tools to monitor ranges and rebalance manually.\
**Solution:** Used a Meow Agent vault to automatically deploy capital into optimal ranges.\
**Result:** Maintained >95% of capital in range over 30 days, improving returns with minimal intervention.

***

**3. Automated LP Bot - Arbitrage-Resistant Liquidity**

**Challenge:** Frequent price swings caused inefficient range positions during high volatility.\
**Solution:** Integrated Meow Agent with volatility-aware policies to pause rebalances in unstable periods.\
**Result:** Reduced impermanent loss exposure by \~18% compared to continuous rebalancing strategies.

These examples are just the beginning - the same principles apply to any AMM or liquidity strategy.
